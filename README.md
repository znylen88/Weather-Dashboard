# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
This project was created to fine tune my web development skills in the areas of both jquery and AJAX methods using APIs. The objective was to create a simple weather dashboard which would display a search area to the left and a weather rendering area to the right, which included both a "current weather" card and also a "5-day forecast" card. In addition to this, local storage needed to be utilized to render past searches to the search area. The "current weather" card was required to contain the city name, the date, and an icon which would translate the current weather (cloud, sun, rain, etc.). Also required was the current temperature, humidity, and UV index. The "5-day forecast" card was required to display five days of weather for the given location and contain the date, temperature, humidity, and a weather icon. I felt more comfortable on this project as I'm slowly becoming more use to the syntax of coding. However, I did struggle to get some of the API addresses to call properly. Not sure if openweather just has poor documentation but seemed more complicated than it needed to be for the UV-index address in particular. Also, rendering icons to the weather cards was especially challenging. Overall, this was my favorite project thus far and really enjoyed creating the functionality.

## Usage
When the page loads, enter a US city name using proper spacing and click the search button. Not entering an input will render no results.
The page will load current weather data for the input city in the top right corner and a 5-day forecast in the bottom right corner.
Previous search will appear below the search input area.
